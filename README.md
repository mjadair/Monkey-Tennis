# MONKEY TENNIS <img src= assets/TennisMonkey.png height=50 width=80 />


## Overview <img src= assets/tennisball.png height=20 width=20 />

This is an ongoing project that I will be adding to sporadically. 

After completing my first game, [Space Wars]((https://mjadair.github.io/Space-Wars/) ), in vanilla JavaScript I sought out frameworks that could be used to more effectively make a JavaScript game rendered in the browser. This led me to [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/). 

Whilst reading through the documentation, an episode of _I'm Alan Partridge_ was on TV in the background. The scene where Alan is desparately pitching programme ideas to a BBC TV Executive, ideas including _Youth Hostelling With Chris Eubank_ and _Monkey Tennis_. I thought I'd try my hand at making Alan's dreams of Monkey Tennis a reality. 

Youth Hostelling with Chris Eubank may follow...
